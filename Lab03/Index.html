            <h3>Reflection 1</h3>
            <p class="highlight">
                Starting my web development journey has been both exciting and challenging.
                Learning HTML has helped me understand the structure of webpages and how different elements work together.
                As I practice, I am becoming more comfortable with coding and organizing content efficiently.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML provides the foundation for every webpage.</li>
                <li>Using proper structure improves readability and maintainability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My Web Development Goals</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Master HTML and CSS for webpage styling.</li>
                <li>Learn JavaScript to add interactivity.</li>
                <li>Build my first personal website.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Resources That Helped Me</h3>
            <p>Here are some useful links I explored during my learning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection 2</h3>
            <p class="highlight">
                In this lab, I applied CSS styling to improve the look of my webpage.
                I experimented with colors, text formatting, and spacing to make my content more readable.
                One challenge I faced was making sure my CSS was properly linked, but I resolved it by checking the file path.
                Overall, I now feel more confident in using CSS to enhance webpage design.
