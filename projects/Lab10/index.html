        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <section>
            <p>The W3C has developed XML Signature Properties as a web standard which extends XML digital signature functionalities. 
                XML Signature Properties enables signature flexibility through the addition of optional properties that explain signature timing, creator identity and signing methodology. 
                A basic XML signature functions without these properties yet they provide valuable features for complex or secure application settings.
            </p>

            <p>
                This standard establishes signature properties which include details about signature timing, signer identification and signing policy and additional data from external timestamps and applications. 
                The standard uses an XML format to store these properties which delivers flexibility through an extensible design that enables them to integrate with different system types.

            <p>
                Developers can add more transparency and traceability to digital signatures through this standard which acts as an extension to XML Signature specifications. 
                The combination of XML Signature Properties provides enhanced trust configuration for XML documents during signature processing.
