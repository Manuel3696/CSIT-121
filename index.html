    <h1>National Park Foundation Site Usability Evaluation</h1>
    
    <h2>Key Details of the Website</h2>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> National Park Foundation</p>
    <p><strong>Site URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.nationalparks.org" target="_blank">https://www.nationalparks.org</a></p>
    <p><strong>Website's Target Audience:</strong> The website targets nature enthusiasts, travelers, conservationists, educators, donors and individuals interested in volunteering within national parks.</p>

    <h2>Site Organization</h2>
    <p> National Park Foundation website makes use of a hierarchical organization structure based both on categorical and task oriented navigation.The site is organized with a clear navigation bar at the top that entails About, Our Work, Stories, Ways To Support, Partnerships, and News. A secondary utility navigation is also used by the site for easy navigation to search and donation options. Additionally, the site uses cards and sections to group related information, thereby giving it a clear visual hierarchy</p>
    
    <h2>CRAP Design Principles Applied</h2>
    <p>National Park Foundation's website effectively uses the Contrast principle by incorporating bold typography and high-contrast colors to ensure readability. For instance, in white backgrounds the site utilizes black text over and white color text on dark backgrounds as well as images, thereby enhancing visual appeal and accessibility. The call to action buttons, including the donation button, are dark-blue in color for more contrast with the white background, and make them more noticeable and more likely to pique your interest in donating, contacting or signing up for their newsletter</p>
    <p>Additionally, the site utilizes repetition. Heads, buttons and card layouts are all uniformed through the site. All pages use the same color scheme (blue and white backgrounds, fonts in white, black and blue colors, and images with earth tones) to repeat the brand identity throughout the experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessibility Audit</h2>
    <p>The site scored 64% as shown in the images below.</p>
    <p>Generally, the site passed all interaction an dnavigation tests. The website scored highly on visual and structural accessibility with screen reader and assistive technology test compliance issues hugely dragging its score down. The site passed 26 audits, with only 2 critical issues raised visual and structural accessibility. Key errors were in ARIA parent elements missing child elements and ARIA attributes missing valid values. </p>

    <h2>Usability Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Effectiveness</h3>
    <p>The site effectively guides users to explore parks, learn about conservation efforts, and donate. It presents multiple options for donation, as donation pathways are clear, search function is complete with pinpoint related searches, and well-designed contact us section that allows users to easily enter their details and message. Most actions are completed accurately on the first attempt with few errors or confusion. It provides efficient communication of its purpose and directs the users to click on the proper action.</p>
    
    <h3>Efficiency</h3>
    <p>The website loads quickly and allows users to navigate between pages with ease. First, search function is displayed prominently on the top of the page with quick results, second, from nearly any page, it is possible to donate in 1-3 clicks. Mobile responsiveness provides for maximum management across devices, and page load times in general are quite quick with optimized images. However, specific information about lesser-known parks is hard to come by, especially not with a combination of clicks, and the donation could be made more automated.</p>
    
    <h3>Engagement</h3>
    <p>By high quality inspiring photography of national parks, clean, nature inspired design which fits the organization’s mission and compelling stories of conservation and impact, the National Park Foundation website provides an interesting user experience. For instance, park finding options are placed into categories like history and culture, youth engagement and education, and history, and culture, and their work clearly listed, thereby providing wonderful interactive elements which also inspire action. Also, the visual design and content approach used by the site is highly appropriate to an environmental conservation organization, establishing an emotional connection with the users.</p>
    
    <h2>Recommendation</h2>
    <p>This accessibility audit revealed some extremely important factors that need to be corrected to make the user experience more favorable for people with disabilities. Specifically, there's need to fix ARIA attributes and the semantic use of &lt;li&gt; elements, and not forget about ARIA parent elements and their required child elements. Even more, the size and the space of touch targets should be adjusted such that they can hold sufficient size for users with motor impairments. If these issues are fixed, that would significantly help to improve the site’s accessibility with WCAG standards and will be a better experience for users that use screen readers or assistive technologies.</p>
