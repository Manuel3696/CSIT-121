                <h3>Challenges and Triumphs</h3>
                <p>This final project was rewarding and challenging at the same time. One of the most satisfying factors was witnessing all of the work I've completed throughout the semester come together and form one, fully cohesive portfolio. The challenge was to design them all so that the pages each had their own function but remain consistently designed. </p>
                <p>Planning and layout decisions do indeed help or hinder user experience and not having any experience designing labs before this project, I had to reallocate much of the original lab work to create a better fit for the structure of the site. It was great to have applied all I have learned and to have a site I can be proud of.</p>

                <h3>Observations on Testing Multiple Browsers and Devices.</h3>
                <p>Testing on multiple browsers (Chrome and Firefox) and testing it on my phone gave me an insight into what would happen across browsers and seen how the site would reflect itself on a mobile device. I've noticed a little bit differences in margins and paddings rendering from it on Firefox. </p>
                <p>While on mobile I realized the navigation bar was not readable and not easily accessible with touch. All of these differences encouraged me to hone my media queries and really get into the layout behavior to make my site more flexible and beneficial for my users.</p>

                <h3>My Reflection on this Course </h3>
                <p>Having completed this course, I've also learnt the basics of building a website: writing semantic HTML; styling with CSS; making it adaptive and responsive to a wide variety of devices; adding interactivity through JavaScript to make everything clickable and work through user behavior. Iâ€™ve also come to realize that accessibility, proper structure, and the validation of work with another person are all areas which should not be overlooked. </p>
                <p>The labs grew upon each other and with every lab there was growing confidence in my ability to build websites from scratch. This gave me enough information and skills so that I can know how all the pieces fit into the puzzle, and how capable I am to learn and build more advanced web projects in the future.</p>
                <p>Finally, I must acknowledge that I would'nt have gained this mileage without the invaluable guidance and constant feedback by my course instructor. It is through the feedback that i've been able to see my errors and continually improve my coding skills. Moreover, valuable resources available through the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions" target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a> have really aided my learning. I'm determine to continue learning new skills and web development technologies all through.</p>
