    <h2>Image Description</h2>
    <p>This image portrays the shape of a human heart filled with various thing like a bicycle, skipping ropes, gym equipment like a deadlift, electronics like a smartphone with an earphone an a timer, as well as food items like kale, spinach, carrot, stake, annd berries. At the center of the image is a label written in bold, capitalized, and reading "Healthy Lifestyle"</p>
    <p>This image clearly portrays the secrets of healthy living, which are supporte by the items it contains. Each single item builds up to the intended lifestyle. For instance, the bicycle, skipping ropes, running shoes, and deadlifts sytmbolize the fitness aspect of leaing a healthy life. That is, jogging, skipping the rope, lifting weights, and cycling are shown to be supportive of such a life</p>
    <h2>Image File Type Information</h2>
    <p>This image is a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file type, a lossless compression format that supports transparency through an alpha channel thereby blending with parent background color. It's ideal for images that require precise detail preservation, transparency, or images with text, line art, and graphics with few colors.</p>
    <h2>Why I Chose the Image</h2>
    <p>I chose this picture due to its ability to clearly demonstrate PNG's property of transparency. The fact that the "Healhty Lifestyle" label at the center of the image appears to be a bit camouflaged beacause PNG is transparent and thereby the letters appear less visible due to my website's dark background. The clean edges and ability to blend seamlessly with any background color make PNG the preferred format for logos, icons, and graphics that need to be placed on different colored backgrounds.</p>
